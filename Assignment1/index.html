                    My name is Matt Auretta and I'm currently a student at Denver University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp! I grew up in Connecticut,
                    lived in Vermont for a bit, and moved to Colorado as soon as I could! I love skiing, rock climbing, backpacking
                    and pretty much everything outdoors. If you can't find me playing outside I'm either playing music or
                    cramming my brain with newfound code!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my past work experience I've been a concert rigger and stagehand, which aligned nicely with my passion of music. After
                    doing that for a couple years and surprisingly growing tired of pulling up steel motor chains 80 feet
                    in the air, I wanted to expand my skillset and started running audio and video for events as well. I
                    really started to immerse myself in the technology side of the field at this point but still felt myself
                    wanting more after a couple additional years. My mortality also set in and I realized I didn't want to do manual labor for the rest of
                    my life. I found coding and fell in love with it, the combination of critical thinking and creativity
                    is exactly what I've been looking for. I'm super excited for the road ahead of me, can't wait to see where this journey takes me, 
                    and am very hopeful that I can help make a difference in the world through code!
